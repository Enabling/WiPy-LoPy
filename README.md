# WiPy-LoPy
Code to help our users getting started with these devices (Python)


You're welcome to have a go with these and we welcome your comments, feedback, improvements, questions, ....


It's still a work in progress and the LoRa side of things will evolve as soon as the devices become available and the libraries are mature enough.


Cheers,
The EnCo team.
